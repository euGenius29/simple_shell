# C - Simple Shell
This is a group project assigned to MERITXELL and EUGENIUS by ALX SE to put to practice all learned so far.
The aim is to create a user defined shell that meets the following objectives.

## Objectives
* Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command
* Handle command lines with arguments
* Handle the PATH
* Implement the ```exit``` built-in to close the shell, ```env``` to print the current environment
